# Monte Carlo Simulation in Python

The Milk Dataset is from Peru, with weekly data for multiple years. Using this data, our team was tasked to advise the management as to what they should do. This includes marketing strategies (feature and display in OJ Dataset).  

The Monte Carlo Simulation had the following conditions:

If Demand <= Inventory:

_Profit  =  Sales * (Price  –  Cost)  –  Unsold * (Inventory – Sales)_

If Demand > Inventory:

_Profit  =  Inventory * (Price  –  Cost)  –  Shortage * (Sales - Inventory)_

Note: Unsold inventory is defined as inventory that was available to sell but was unable to do so. This means that our purchase and holding costs will be higher.
A Shortage occurs when there is insufficient goods to sell. This implies that a possible profit has been lost.
