# Monte Carlo Simulation in Python

##Data Optimization Team Project @ Hult International Business School

The Milk Dataset is from Peru, with weekly data for multiple years. Using this data, our team was tasked to advise the management as to what they should do. This includes marketing strategies (feature and display in OJ Dataset).  Some suggestions or ideas are to: 

1. Estimate Quantity Demanded as a function of price (and similar prices) using a Log Transformation. You can also include marketing strategies in your regression.

2. Combine Gross Margin information to advise the firm on maximizing profits. To avoid sales cannibalization, simultaneously include multiple products. Depending on how you set this up, you might be able to use Solver in Excel to find the optimal strategy. It is a NLP.

3. The estimates of margins and demand are only estimates. Perform Monte Carlo analysis to simulate different strategies even if your estimate is not perfect (draw the regression coefficients from a normal with mean = estimate and standard deviation = standard error).
